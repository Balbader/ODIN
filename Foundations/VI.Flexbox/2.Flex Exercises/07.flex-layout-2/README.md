# The Holy Grail of Layout

In this last flexbox exercise you're going to recreate an incredibly common
website layout.<br>
It is so common that it is often called the Holy Grail layout...
and with flexbox it is actually pretty easy to pull off.<br>

### Hints

• You will need to change the flex-direction to push the footer down.<br>
• You will need to add some divs as containers to get things to line up correctly.<br>
• flex-wrap will help get the cards aligned correctly.<br>

## Desired Outcome

<br>
<br>
The number of cards lined up in that section will change based on the width of
your screen, so don't stress about getting exactly a 2x3 or 3x2 grid.
<br>
On a smaller screen it will look like this:<br>

### Self Check

• The header text is size 32px and weight 900.<br>
• The header text is vertically centered and 16px from the edge of the screen.<br>
• The footer is pushed to the bottom of the screen (the footer may go below the
• bottom of the screen if the content of the 'cards' section overflows and/or
• if your screen is shorter).<br>
• The footer text is centered horizontally and vertically.<br>
• The sidebar and cards take up all available space above the footer.<br>
• The sidebar is 300px wide (and it doesn't shrink).<br>
• The sidebar links are size 24px, are white, and do not have the underline text decoration.<br>
• The sidebar has 16px padding.<br>
• There is 32px padding around the 'cards' section.<br>
• The cards are arranged horizontally, but wrap to multiple lines when they run out of room on the page.
