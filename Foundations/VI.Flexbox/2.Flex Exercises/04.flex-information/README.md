# A very common website feature

The goal of this exercise is to recreate a section that is found on many
informational websites.<br>
<br>
For this one you will need to edit the HTML a little bit too. We can't be
making things too easy for you. You'll want to add containers around the
various elements so that you can flex them. Good luck!<br>
